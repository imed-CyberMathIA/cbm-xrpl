> Web3Auth is where passwordless auth meets non-custodial key infrastructure for Web3 apps and wallets. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets and innovative Multi Party Computation (MPC) - Web3Auth provides a seamless login experience to every user on your application.

Web3Auth Single Factor Auth is the SDK that gives you the ability to start with just one key (aka, Single Factor) with Web3Auth, giving you the flexibility of implementing your own UI and UX.

## üîó Installation

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/single-factor-auth
```

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Get your Client ID from Web3Auth Dashboard

Hop on to the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) and create a new project. Use the Client ID of the project to start your integration.

### Initialize Web3Auth for your preferred blockchain

Web3Auth needs to initialize as soon as your app loads up to enable the user to log in. Preferably done within a constructor, initialization is the step where you can pass on all the configurations for Web3Auth you want. A simple integration for Ethereum blockchain will look like this:

**Note**
This package can only be used with verifiers created on the developer dashboard.

```js
import { Web3Auth } from "@web3auth/single-factor-auth";
import { EthereumPrivateKeyProvider } from "@web3auth/ethereum-provider";

//Initialize within your constructor
const web3auth = new Web3Auth({
  clientId: "", // Get your Client ID from Web3Auth Dashboard
  web3AuthNetwork: "mainnet",
  usePnPKey: false, // Setting this to true returns the same key as PnP Web SDK. 
  // By default, this SDK returns CoreKitKey.
});

const chainConfig: {
  chainNamespace: "eip155",
  chainId: "0x1",
  rpcTarget: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth",
};

const provider = new EthereumPrivateKeyProvider({ config: { chainConfig } })

await web3auth.init(provider);
```

### Login your User

Once you're done initialising, just create a button that triggers login with the JWT and verifier details.

```js
await web3auth.connect({
  verifier: "verifier-name", // e.g. `web3auth-sfa-verifier` replace with your verifier name, and it has to be on the same network passed in init().
  verifierId: "verifier-id-value", // e.g. `Yux1873xnibdui` or `name@email.com` replace with your verifier id(sub or email)'s value.
  idToken: "JWT Token", // replace with your newly created unused JWT Token.
});
```
